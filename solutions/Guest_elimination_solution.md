Let G be this thirsty men game, N number of players, M number of ressources and lets suppose that players are rational (they wanna win the game)
- If G is a one round game :
  - Would work only if N = 1 or N = 2 and M >= 2.
- If G is a multiple round game: We can expect cooperation between players for their greatest good
  - M is finite:
    - M = k * N, k >=1
    - Cases discussion:
      - M is even, N is even:
         1) Randomly choose 2 participants, Let them be A and B.
         2) Make A play first, wait for the others (beside B) to play, then B plays last ==> A and B get their part
         3) Randomly choose 2 participlants that havent been chosen yet. Let them be A and B. Repeat Step 2
      - M is even, N is odd:
        - Same as M even, N even. Except for the last round, we should expect someone to take an additional cup (they can choose him randomly or ...)
      - Same reasoning for the other 2 cases
  - M is infinite (N can be finite or infinite):
    - same as M even, N even
    - All players will wait for their tour to come (to be chosen randomly) knowing it will come someday and not being afraid that the resources would end.
    
- Since the randomization should be trusted by all players. The host can do it and share the results, or else another third party.
- Under these conditions, we can assume that all players will follow the strategy or that there is a slashing mechanism for them to stick to the plan.
- also assumes that players wont join the game before it finishes distributing atay to all the participants
